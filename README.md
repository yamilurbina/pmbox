# PMBox
PMBox stands for ProcessMaker Box, an easy solution to virtualize a server and provision it with Puppet to install and start using ProcessMaker.

Apart from ProcessMaker, PMBox installs git, oh-my-zsh and PHPMyAdmin as additional tools, so it's ready for plugin development and testing.

### Works on any major OS
From Windows to Linux and Mac OS X, PMBox works without any extra requirements or configuration hassles.

## Requirements

- VirtualBox 4.2+ [virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Extension Pack for VirtualBox [virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Vagrant 1.1+ [vagrantup.com](http://vagrantup.com)

### Installing Vagrant
Check out Vagrant's official documentation [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)


## PMBox installation
Once you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, place the following on your terminal (you need git):

    $ git clone git://github.com/yamilurbina/PMBox.git
    $ cd PMBox

### Vagrant
Let's start our PMBox machine with a single command:

    $ vagrant up

From there, Vagrant will take charge and start showing information like this:

    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    [default] Importing base box 'pmbox'…
    [default] Setting the name of the VM...networking...
    [default] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...
    [default] Creating shared folders metadata...
    [default] Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    
Now it's the perfect time to get some coffee, and depending on your internet connection speed, the process shouldn't take more than 5-8 minutes.

### ProcessMaker

Once everything completes on the vagrant side, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and follow the ProcessMaker wizard to finish the installation.

**Note:** When prompted for the MySQL password, type: `processmaker`

## Usage

### SSH access
SSH access is provided by vagrant, check out their official documentation:
[http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh.html](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh.html)

### PHPMyAdmin

Open [http://localhost:8080/mysql](http://localhost:8080/mysql)

    user: root
    password: processmaker

### ProcessMaker plugins

PMBox is able to generate ProcessMaker plugins out of the box. Follow this steps to generate a simple plugin. Inside your box (SSH), type:
 
    $ cd /opt/processmaker/workflow/engine
    $ php gulliver new-plugin PMBoxDemoPlugin

From there, gulliver will prompt you for the features you need for your plugin. To read more about this and also set the symlinks for your plugin, you can check the official ProcessMaker wiki page: [http://wiki.processmaker.com/index.php/2.0.36/Plugin_Development](http://wiki.processmaker.com/index.php/2.0.36/Plugin_Development)

##### Plugins folder
Browse to the `plugins` folder on your PMBox directory to find the plugins generated by gulliver. From there, you can edit your files on a text editor and the changes will be reflected instantly.

## Final words
I really hope you enjoy PMBox as much as I enjoyed developing it. The need for a descentralized way to work on ProcessMaker was something that needed a solution, and this, paired with the wonderful duo of VirtualBox and Vagrant, makes it come true.

And of course, this is free to use, modify, fork and publish.
